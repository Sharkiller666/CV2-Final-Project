## Description
This project presents an innovative approach to event design and planning using Virtual Reality (VR) technology. It leverages 3D reconstruction and surface normal estimation to create realistic representations of physical spaces. By modeling the environment in 3D, the VR system accurately positions virtual objects, providing a clear preview of potential designs.
